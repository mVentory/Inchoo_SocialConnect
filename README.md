Inchoo_SocialConnect
====================

Inchoo_SocialConnect is a Magento extension allowing your customers to login or create an account at your store using their Google, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn account.

For usage instructions and more details you can visit my [article at inchoo.net](http://inchoo.net/ecommerce/magento/social-connect-magento-extension/).


About this fork
====================

The original extension was theme dependent and required endless customisation of some page templates to blend the styling into the theme. 

We moved the login part to a popup making it much less theme dependent.
